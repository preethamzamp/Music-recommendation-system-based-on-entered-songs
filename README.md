# Music-recommendation-system-based-on-entered-songs
This project aims to enhance music listening by developing a robust recommendation system using classical machine learning models. It analyzes user preferences, listening behavior, song attributes (e.g., danceability, energy), and social interactions, employing content-based, collaborative, and hybrid filtering methods.
